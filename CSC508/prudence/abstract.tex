\begin{abstract}
Software in safety critical systems inevitably brings about the question of
negligence liability from product defects. This paper examines the fundamental
process inadequacies during the software development lifecycle that trigger
defective software and specifies an improvement to this process model that can
be introduced into this lifecycle to help reduce the losses due to negligence 
liability.
