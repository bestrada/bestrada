\subsubsection*{Documentation Attitude}
The success of this system requires a forward-thinking attitude of commitment to
documentation. Most domains of software engineering spend minimal time with
formal documentation methods in an effort to achieve faster turnaround and
short-term gain through quick (and often rushed) implementation cycles. This
disregard to the care of formal documentation may yield better immediate gains,
but ultimately degrades the quality of the implementation, reusability of the
software,  and traceability of design decisions.
