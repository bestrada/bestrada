\section{Adding Prudence to Process}
Fortunately, the risk of negligence liability and the cost to defend
unavoidable risks can be reduced. This research includes an analysis of safety
critical software systems that identifies the specific inequities of software
that complicate process interpretation. We then determine the inadequacies of
current practices that increase the risk of negligence liability in software.
We finally provide recommendations to enhance an organization’s process and
mitigate this risk.

The model proposed in this paper introduces an improvement to the software
engineering workflow designed for safety-critical environments that will
provide traceable documentation that developers can use minimize software
defects and lawyers can use to defend (or confirm) negligence.
