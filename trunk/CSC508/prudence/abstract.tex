Software in safety critical systems inevitably brings about the question of
negligence liability from product defects that cause injury or harm. This
paper examines the fundamental process inadequacies during the software
development lifecycle that trigger defective software and specifies an
improvement to this process model that can be introduced into the workflow of
sofware development to help reduce the losses due to negligence liability.
