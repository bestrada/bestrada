Software in safety critical systems inevitably brings about the question of
negligence liability from product defects that cause injury or harm. This
paper examines the fundamental process inadequacies during the software
development process lifecycle that trigger defects in software. We specifies an
improvement to this process model that overcomes these inadequacies and can
be introduced into the workflow of sofware development to help reduce the losses
due to negligence liability.
