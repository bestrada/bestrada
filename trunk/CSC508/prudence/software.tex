\section{The Software Development Process}

The sofware development lifecycle is host of several key process areas defined
for efficient organizations.

\subsection{Properties of Software}

There are key attributes about software that make it intrinsically different
from other fields of engineering. These areas distinguish software engineering
from traditional engineering in a way that complicates the process for
safety-critical organizations.

\subsubsection*{Material Costs}

There are no upfront material costs to begin software implementation. Generic,
over-the-shelf hardware like personal computers can be used to produce
tremendous feats in software engineering. In fact, Google, Inc. started by using
commodotity machines to create what is now one of the most ubiquitous tools in
computing \cite{Google}.

\subsubsection*{Fast Turnaround}

More and more clients are demanding speed in implementation. Software developers
often deliver what is requested of them for immediate profit over long-term gain.
