\chapter{Background}

Whether software engineers are aware of it or not, the programs they write are
heavily regulated by the public policy and the law. In software, the tacit
struggle between legal demands for safety and economic profitability hinders
technical progress and innovation. In isolation from one another, this chapter
explores the details of these two forces: (1) legal regulation for safety and
(2) technical innovation and profit.

\section{Legal Regulation}
\begin{quote}
``\textit{\ldots [the law], by the very necessity of its nature, is continually
transmuting those moral standards into external or objective ones\ldots}''
\flushright{\textsc{-Oliver Wendell Holmes} \cite{Holmes23}}
\end{quote}


The intent of the law is, broadly, to achieve and preserve justice 
\cite{McAdams07}. In order to assure the safety of products, the law will often
rely on common law principles \cite{Turner99}. The common law regulates based
on judgments found in previous courtroom decisions rather than on statutes
adopted by legislative bodies.

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Common Law Model}
\label{fig:commonlaw}
\end{figure}

The model in Figure \ref{fig:commonlaw} generalizes how the legal system
handles disputes (specifically disputes involving defective products) and
updates itself through an iterative feedback process. For the legal system to
be invoked, some sort of disputable accident or injury must occur. Victims who
have suffered loss will then file a lawsuit. Facts are gathered through
searching through evidence and recording testimonies. After the facts are agreed
upon, both sides will make arguments calling into question the legality of what
happened, using precedent set from previous judgments. A judge interprets what
the law states and either he or a jury decides how it will apply in each
individual case. Once a decision is rendered, a case will oftentimes go through
an appeal wherein an unsatisfied party petitions a higher court to review the
decisions of a lower court to correct errors. More arguments are made on the
legality of the previous decision, but new facts, testimony, or evidence are no
longer accepted. Once an appellate decision is made, \textit{that} holding
enters legal archives and serves as precedent for future cases.

The \textit{legal archive} consists of rulings and opinions from previous
disputes. These rulings can then be used to make decisions in the future. This
is how the common law updates itself. If an unprecedented situation comes to
suit, then the courts will have to interpret \textit{similar} situations and
apply them at the discretion of the judge.

What is noteworthy of the model in Figure \ref{fig:commonlaw} is the
retroactive application of legal decisions to each scenario. The common law is a
reactive, feedback system because only \textit{after} accident or injury occurs
will legal repercussions be dealt with in a new product's development lifecycle.
When a judgment is made, it can then be applied to future scenarios, but usually
only if a lawsuit is filed.

\subsection{Common Law Characteristics}

The common law ``\textit{is that part of the law that is within the province of
the courts themselves to establish}'' \cite{Eisenberg88}. The common law
exhibits many characteristics that make it just. Social propositions (those of
morality, policy, or experience rather than state legal rules) are enforced
impartially to any party. The courts practice a replicable system of litigation,
allowing future disputants to have recieve legal advice and planning. The common
law is also responsive to change as moral norms evolve over time 
\cite{Eisenberg88}.

Those who are affected by the common law should understand the principles of its
underpinnings. Software engineers working on safety-critical projects are
affected by the social expectations of reliable software and functional
software. But because of its unique nature, defects in software are inevitable
and typically more difficult to locate and handle than the physical flaws found
in mechanical components \cite{Parnas90}. Defects in software used in
safety-critical situations can be especially dangerous. The increasing use of
software in machines and the demand for more product functions adds complexity
and more room for error. Fortunately, the legal system can account for this
inherent complexity.

While the legal system is in place to (among other things) ensure the safety of
products, it should be noted that the law understands the costs involved in
ensuring safety measures and takes this into consideration when resolving
disputes. Scholars posit that the law balances these economic forces and ensures
safety to a reasonable cost of manufacturers \cite{Rubin77,Priest77}.

Some lawyers contend that the law evolves towards efficient decisions in 
accident disputes in courts, where ``\textit{efficient}'' in this context means
that the defendants are more likely than the victims to win the suit if an
accident occurs. This means, in terms of software engineering, that the
organization that develops a safety-critical software product will, in the long
run, tend towards winning (or possibly avoiding) dispute. This evolution towards
efficiency comes from the pressures of the litigants who have a vested interest
in the outcome of cases because they are likely to be involved in similar
disputes in the future. The party that is interested in precedent (in this
case, the defendant software development organization) will litigate until a
favorable decision is met. This means that manufacturers that are likely to be
involved in accident disputes will make preventative efforts to improve the
safety of their products so as to avoid liability in court cases \cite{Rubin77}
and more easily defend themselves in case of a dispute.

\subsection{Products Liability}

The term \textit{products liability} broadly applies to the liability of a
manufacturer or seller for injury to a buyer caused by a product that has been
sold \cite{Prosser}. A \textit{product} usually refers to physical 
merchandise that can be purchased. Officially, a product is defined as 
\begin{quote}
``\textit{\ldots tangible personal property distributed commercially for use or
consumption and other items, such as real property and electricity, when the
context of their distribution and use is sufficiently analogous to the
distribution and use of tangible personal property\ldots}(\cite{Rest3d}, 
\S19(a))''
\end{quote}

In the case of safety-critical systems, software is usually embedded in
some machine or hardware device \cite{Leveson95} that is sold as a product. When
viewed from this standpoint, software is less analogous to pure thoughts and
expressions and may be considered a product for products liability cases.

\subsubsection{Negligence}\label{SS:Negligence}
While the development of products liability based on breach of warranty and
strict products liability doctrines have, to an extent, reduced the utility of
negligence because in these forms the proof of specific negligence is
unnecessary (\cite{AmLaw} Chapter 10, \S 10:1.), we apply negligence law to our
research. Negligence is concerned with process, not with product. The question
is not whether software development can be applied to negligence law, but if
negligence law can apply to software development. The legal term 
\textit{negligence} refers to, in general, careless conduct. Scholars describe
negligence more specifically as (57A \cite{AmJur}, Negligence \S 5.):\singlespace
\begin{itemize}
 \item the existence and violation of a legal duty to use care, proximately 
 causing injury to another.
 \item the failure to exercise the degree of care demanded by the circumstances.
 \item the breach of a duty to another to protect him or her from the particular
 harm that ensued.
 \item the want of that care the law prescribes under the particular
 circumstances existing at the time of the act or omission which is involved.
\end{itemize}\doublespace
Negligence can be applied to many different scenarios beyond products
liability. An intoxicated driver who disobeys traffic laws may be negligent
towards other citizens of the road\footnote{\textit{See: People v. Townsend},
214 Mich. 267, 272, 183 N.W. 177.}. A instructor who fails to demonstrate safety
precautions to his students in wood shop may be liable for
negligence\footnote{\textit{See: Voorhies v. Conroe Independent School Dist.},
610
F.Supp. 868.}. An engineer who does not adequately inspect his high-integrity
product can be negligent to his clients\footnote{\textit{See: Ford Motor Co. v.
Mondragon}, 271 F.2d 342.}. This research focuses on the negligence constrains
as they apply to products liability.

Negligence is easiest to determine when some standard of care stated by the
profession is available. Since no such standard exists for software engineering,
a more qualitative approach must be taken. Figure \ref{fig:handtest} shows a
formula that equates negligence in terms of unreasonable behavior.  According to
the Learned Hand test\footnote{\textit{See: United States v. Carroll Towing
Co.}, 159
F.2d 169.\\ Judge Learned Hand created this guideline to determine the amount of
duty owed in a negligence dispute. In the case, the United States sought
compensation for flour that was lost when a barge carrying the cargo sunk. The
barge company was partly responsible because no workers were present on the
barge when it sank, which may have prevented the barge from sinking.
Qualitatively, the amount it would have cost to keep a worker on the barge would
have been less than the product of the probability that the barge sank and the
amount of damages incurred from it sinking.}, an organization that develops
safety-critical software has a duty to spend at least the amount of time and
resources equivalent to the product of the severity of harm and the likelihood 
that it will happen. If they do not, then their actions are negligent. The
Learned Hand test is an important metric because it provides a way to evaluate
the existence of negligence without the presence of a strict standard.

\paragraph{Elements of Negligence\\}
The applicability of negligence requires that certain conditions exist and the
laws of negligence can only be invoked in these situations. The prerequisites,
or prima facie elements, of a negligence case are \cite{Dobbs01}:
\singlespace
\begin{enumerate}
 \item there exists a duty of care (or duty to protect)
 \item the defendant breaches this duty with unreasonably risky conduct
 \item the defendant's conduct resulted in harm to the plaintiff
 \item the negligent conduct was a proximate cause of harm
 \item legally recognized damages or injury exist
\end{enumerate}
\doublespace
First, a negligence case calls for an actual duty of care owed to a plaintiff.
There may be a question about how much care is owed in a given situation, but
there are circumstances in which there is no duty owed that bears on the harm a
plaintiff suffers. Judges decide whether or not this duty exists.

Also, there must be a breach of this duty of care owed. A defendant who behaves
reasonably and exercises the necessary care required by law will not be
negligent even if the plaintiff is harmed.

The defendant's negligence must be the cause of the harm suffered by the
plaintiff. An careless engineer who does not test his product is not negligent
to the user who is injured by tripping over the machine. In addition, the cause
must not only be cause in fact, but a proximate, or primary, cause of the harm
suffered.

Finally, actual damages or injuries must be suffered for a negligence case to
follow suit. This can include personal injury or damages to property.

\paragraph{Software Fulfills the Prima Facie\\}

It is not a stretch to conclude that defective software in a safety-critical
situation will be subject to negligence allegations. The developing
organization clearly owes a duty of care to its customers. Since the software
will be used to perform tasks that can potentially cause harm, its users expect
a reasonably prudent amount of care from its developers.

The remaining elements are assumptions that this research seeks to evaluate.
Performing tests is a large part of quality assurance for software and doing it
correctly can mitigate the risk of unreasonably breaching a duty of care.

\paragraph{Professional Negligence and Software Licensing\\}
Professional negligence, also commonly referred to as malpractice, requires that
the defendant be a member of some profession \cite{Kaner96}. When judging a
negligence case, the courts hold defendants to a certain standard of care.
Professionals communicate their skills with some kind of license and are thusly
held to a greater degree of care than expected of ordinary people. Though
software engineers do possess special skills that ordinary people do not, they
are not considered ``professions'' as the term is used
doctrinally\footnote{\textit{See: Heidtman Steel Products, Inc. v. Compuware
Computer Corporation}, 178 F. Supp. 2d 869.}.

As of the time of writing this paper, there is no widely accepted standard body
of knowledge that software engineers can be licensed upon \cite{Knight02}.
Software is intrinsically different, which embodies most of the reason why there
cannot exist a software engineering license. Though a license would enforce a
\textit{strict} standard of care on all those who practice, it would be
impractical and infeasible to impose this standard on such a comprehensive and
growing field as software \cite{Knight02}. For this reason, we will focus our
attention to the ``reasonable person standard'' (\cite{Prosser}, Chapter
5 \S 32) as dictated by the law on ordinary people.

\subsection{The Court System}\label{s:courts}

The court systems in America is a highly technical and sophisticated dispute
resolution mechanism put into place to help disputants reach an agreement.
Though many disputes are settled outside of court, the court system is the
primary to set legal precedent in the common law system that pervades American
Justice. While the exact hierarchy of courts may be much more complex, the
general pattern is shown in Figure \ref{fig:courts}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figures/courts.eps}
\end{center}
\flushright{\footnotesize{adopted from \cite{McAdams07}}}
\caption{State and Federal Court Systems}
\label{fig:courts}
\end{figure}

The left branch of the diagram shows the state court systems. At the base are
trial courts, often referred to as district or superior courts. Most litigation
that this research is concerned with begins at the state trial courts, but
certain specialty areas (such as public utilities and workers' compensation)
have their own reserved courts \cite{McAdams07}. At this level, the trial courts
only hear a case and apply existing precedent to the case. If a disputant wishes
to appeal, he submits a request which can be heard by a higher court. Some
states provide an intermediate court of appeals between the state's highest
court and the trial courts. It as at the appeallate level that legal precedent
is set. When a judge or jury makes a decision at an appeallate court, an opinion
is written and is stored for future cases to use \cite{Eisenberg88}. If the
dispute regards a national or constitutional issue, a disputant may appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court \cite{McAdams07}.

The middle and right branches of Figure \ref{fig:courts} provide the foundation
of the federal judicial system. A similar heirarchy exists in these branches,
but these courts hear cases involving federal law which does not include
the tortious products liability disputes that this research concerned with.

\subsection{Why hasn't our legal system addressed software negligence?}

The American Legal System has still yet to resolve a \textit{real} dispute
involving software. With software now being available for decades and already
causing problems worthy of litigation \cite{Therac25}, why haven't our courts
regulated for safer software?

One reason why our courts have not addressed the issue of software safety is
because of the out-of-court measures that companies will take to
settle disputes. Often times, disputes will be settled through mediation, 
wherein a neutral third party facilitates a compromise of the situation
\cite{McAdams07}. Unfortunately, the law does not get updated through mediation
because a this kind of dispute resolution does not make a determination of right
or wrong, it merely creates an agreement not to pursue trial litigation.

Often, cases will be dismissed because of out-of-court settlements wherein the
defendant compensate the plaintiff at an amount agreed upon by both parties.
Also, it is rare that a case falls under a single law or set of rules. Sometimes
a decision will be made on a case that is based on some other precedent that
allows the judge not to write an opinion regarding software liability.

\section{Technical Evolution}

\begin{quote}
``\textit{This work must be conducted with attention to detail and the highest
standard of professional care.}''
\flushright{\textsc{-St. Jude Medical} \cite{SJMCode}}
\end{quote}

The capabilities of software have, no doubt, changed dramatically since the
introduction of computers decades ago. Society's increasing reliance on
computers and software creates pressure to adapt. Software evolves because
individuals and organizations are integrating computers into their activities
\cite{Lehman98}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figures/technical.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Model of Technical Innovation}
\label{fig:technical}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:technical} is a broad generalization of how the state-of-the-art
of software\footnote{though this model is general and simple enough to apply to
many disciplines} gets updated over time. The process starts in education.
Students learn and apply to current state-of-the-art through various
educational facilities and resources. They will then either enter industry or
conduct research. Industry workers also utilize the state-of-the-art in
practice. \textit{Researchers}, in the general sense of the word, conduct
``research'' in a variety of ways. Ideas can come from purely academic work or
from work-related projects. When discoveries are made, the ideas are preserved
so that the solution can be used to solve similar problems in the future. The
state-of-the-art in software is a juried resource because it consists of
materials reviewed by other experts in the field. Ideas are stored in the
state-of-the-art through, but not limited to, publications (like those released
by the IEEE or the ACM), standards and best-practices, textbooks, and Open
Source libraries.

This state-of-the-art gets employed when software projects are implemented.
The sections that follow briefly present the existing models that describe the
process of software development. In general, though, a client (society) demands
some functionality that can best be implemented using software. Requirements and
designs are laid out, taking into consideration the needs of the client and the
current capabilities of software. Implementors utilize the body of knowledge
(the state-of-the-art) to construct the software, sometimes leading to the
contribution of new knowledge back into the library. When testing is complete,
the software is accepted and delivered.

\subsection{The Software Development Process}
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/waterfall.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Waterfall Model of the Software Process}
\label{fig:waterfall}
\end{figure}

In order to build a quality software systems, many organizations follow a
formal, methodological approach to the development process. The models show that
the the evolution of software is both a proactive, feed-forward system as well
as a reactive, feedback system. The processes are proactive because software
developers use the demands of their clients to write requirements for what they
will implement. Society pushes them to innovate and create software that will be
profitable. At the same time, the process is reactive because testing occurs to
detect errors and inadequacies and are reported back to requirements and design
planning for corrections.

The waterfall and spiral models shown below model the software development
process for individual projects. Both are acceptable models to use on a software
development project, but the sprial model seems to be more accepted because it
is a current, generalized version of many of the previous models.

\subsubsection{Waterfall Model}\label{waterfall}
The original treatment of the waterfall model appears in \cite{Royce1970} and
describes a specification-driven approach to software development. Figure
\ref{fig:waterfall} shows different phases that flow steadily downwards, like a
waterfall. The model stresses a sequential occurrence of events in software
development, but also includes an iterative treatment to account for the 
evolving software development process.

This model shows the widely-accepted phases of the software development process,
but the specific details within each phase are not set-in-stone. The model
defines activities that should go on during requirements, analysis,
implementation, etc. But societal demands may require other considerations to be
made during these phases.

\subsubsection{Spiral Model}\label{spiral}
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/spiral.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Spiral Model of the Software Process}
\label{fig:spiral}
\end{figure}

The spiral model, as described in \cite{Boehm1986}, builds on refinements made
to the waterfall model. Boehm explains that the software process as an iteration
of four phases of activity -- shown as quadrants -- which can be retrofitted to
particularize to a variety of methods and approaches. As illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:spiral}, the radial dimension represents the cumulative costs incurred
in accomplishing the steps to date while the angular dimension represents the
progress made in completing each spiral.

Notice that each rotation around the spiral begins with objectives,
consideration of alternatives, and the constraints on the system so (cost,
schedule, interface, etc.). According to Boehm's model, software developers
should take risks into consideration and these considerations should be
documented.

\section{A Historical Analog}

The amalgamation of these two forces -- (1) the demands of our legal system to
ensure safety in products at a reasonable cost to manufacturers and (2) the
insistence of society and industry to innovate and increase profits -- is the
primary focus of this research.

History shows that the legal ramifications of products liability will limit
technical progress for for manufacturers. In the early 1990s, the small aircraft
industry observed a sharp decline in production –- from about 13,000 units at
its peak in 1977 to only 444 planes in 1994 \cite{Clancy95}. \textit{The Wall
Street Journal} argued that this decline is due, in large part, to 
products-liability laws ``\textit{eating a sick industry alive}'' 
\cite{Smith91}.

In this case, products-liability laws imposed no time limit on the support for
old products. Claims were made against companies involving planes that were
purchased decades before filing suit, causing insurance fees to climb and
scaring off investors \cite{Smith91}. When Congress responded by passing the
General Aviation Revitalization Act (GARA) in 1994, it protected companies from
serious claims involving planes older than 18 years. The risk of liability was
dramatically reduced and insurance costs were cut allowing companies like Piper
Aircraft to develop, thrive, and profit \cite{Valdmanis01}. However, reports
have shown that the alleged ``immunity'' of granted by GARA has also increased
injury related to small aircrafts \cite{Kolczynski03}.

Computer technology and software, unfortunately, has not enjoyed the same rich
history and professional research as some of the other more mature fields of
engineering. Legal disputes involving software have, thus far, not made it much
passed the trial courts and have therefore not yet been formally addressed by
the common law.
