\chapter{Background}\label{C:Background}
The analysis of the sufficiency of testing processes for safety-critical
software systems demands a discussion of constraints. Of particular concern are
the constraints enforced upon software \textit{process}. While there certainly
are liabilities for releasing a product that is defective\footnote{Section 
\ref{S:Liability} details the different forms of liability that software is
vulnerable to.}, the \textit{behavior} of the developer is what is under
scrutiny here. The first part of this chapter reviews the current practices in
software engineering testing processes. We then examine the negligence concerns
regarding these processes.

\section{Current Practices in Software Testing}
Despite the evidence of ineffective safety assurance \cite{Leveson93,Maisel05},
current standards in the software industry illustrate that efforts are being
made to ensure the safety of mission critical software applications. Though
unapproved and unofficial to any governing body, the motivation of these efforts
are best illustrated by principle 1.04 of the Software Engineering Code of
Ethics. This principle mandates that software engineers act consistently with
the public interest and, specifically, shall:

\begin{quote}
``\textit{Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is
safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish
quality of life, diminish privacy or harm the environment. The ultimate effect
of the work should be to the public good.}''\cite{SECODE}
\end{quote}

\subsection{ISO 9000-3}
The International Standards Organization put forth a quality management standard
known as ISO 9001 to describe a set of guidelines that will help organizations
achieve standards of quality that are recognized and respected throughout the
world. The ISO 9001 guidelines are not specifically designed for safety-critical
software (or even software at all), but provide models for quality assurance
in the design, development, production, installation, and servicing of systems
in general \cite{Kehoe96}.

The ISO 9000-3 is the application of ISO 9001 the development, supply, and
maintenance of software. In terms of testing, the ISO 9000-3 standard adopts a
phase approach, similar to the waterfall model explained in \cite{Royce70}. The
six phases, at a high level, are:
\singlespace
\begin{enumerate}
  \item System Engineering/System Analysis
  \item Software Requirements Analysis
  \item Design
  \item Implementation
  \item Testing
  \item Maintenance
\end{enumerate}
\doublespace
According to ISO 9000-3, testing is a pervasive effort, taking place during the
entire product-development cycle. For example: during the requirements phase, a
team must develop a preliminary test plan and identify test cases. During the
design phase, the team develops test cases and updates the test plan. During
implementation, system-level test cases are populated and unit-level test cases
are executed. And during the test phase, the team conducts functional,
integration, and system tests and performs regression testing as needed. For
more information, refer to \cite{Kehoe96}.

\subsection{CMM}
The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) helps organizations achieve mature software
development practices. A mature organization, acording to the CMM, possesses an
organization-wide ability to manage software processes, communicates appropriate
planned processes to staff and employees, and updates its processes when
necessary \cite{CMM11}. Process is important because the law of negligence is
specifically concerned with process\footnote{See Section \ref{SS:Negligence}.}.

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI)\footnote{The SEI and Carnegie Mellon
University developed and released the CMM \cite{CMM11}.} defines process as
``\textit{a set of activities, methods, practices, and transformations that 
people use to develop and maintain software and the associated 
products}''\cite{CMM11}. A software organizations \textit{capability} describes
the range of expected results the organization is expected to achieve based on
its processes and its \textit{maturity} is the extent at which its processes are
defined, managed, measured, controlled, and effective \cite{CMM11}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figures/CMMMaturityLevels.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{The Five Levels of Software Process Maturity}
\label{fig:cmm-levels}
\end{figure}

The CMM guides organizations towards control of their processes and a culture of
software engineering excellence. This is done by determining an organization's
level of maturity and identifying the critical areas that it can improve. The
CMM assigns five levels of maturity (shown in figure \ref{fig:cmm-levels}) to
the software processes of organizations. Each level is at least as mature as the
level before it. Maturity levels indicate process capability and if they are to
be reached an organization must identify and address the goals laid out in the
level's key process areas. Of particular concern in this research is
\textit{Quality Assurance}, a key process area for Level 2: Repeatable maturity.
The goals for this key process area are enumerated below: \singlespace
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Goal 1.} Software quality assurance activities are planned.
  \item \textbf{Goal 2.} Adherence of software products and activities to the
        applicable standards, procedures, and requirements is verified
        objectively.
  \item \textbf{Goal 3.} Affected groups and individuals are informed of
        software quality assurance activities and results.
  \item \textbf{Goal 4.} Noncompliance issues that cannot be resolved within
        the software project are addressed by senior management.
\end{itemize}
\doublespace
The CMM generally lays out goals and activities that an organization can
undertake to achieve process maturity. Again, though the CMM is not targetted
specifically for safety-critical systems, it provides a good place to start to
ensure that the best available practices are being utilized.

\section{Products Liability}\label{S:Liability}
The term \textit{products liability} broadly applies to the liability of a
manufacturer or seller for injury to a buyer caused by a product that has been
sold \cite{Testing2005}. A \textit{product} usually refers to physical 
merchandise that can be purchased\footnote{\textit{Winter v. G.P. Putnam's
Sons}, 938 F.2d 1033.\\In this case, Wilhelm Winter became critically ill
from eating mushrooms that he picked relying on the information in a book
published by Putnam. The judge favored in the side of Putnam, claiming that the
contents of \textit{The Encyclopedia of Mushrooms} is not a product that can be
liable because the law does not take into consideration the unique
characteristics of ideas and expression. However, the plaintiff's argument was
strong when the book was analogized to aeronautical charts - graphical
depictions of technical and mechanical data. They are intended to be used while
engaging in hazardous activity. The discussion also mentions that
\textit{software} may be considered a product for this same reason. Software
that ``\textit{fails to yield the result for which it was designed}'' may be
considered under products liability}. Officially, a product is defined as 
\begin{quote}
``\textit{\ldots tangible personal property distributed commercially for use or
consumption and other items, such as real property and electricity, when the
context of their distribution and use is sufficiently analogous to the
distribution and use of tangible personal property\ldots}\footnote{Restatement
Third, Torts: Products Liability \S 19(a).}''
\end{quote}
In the case of safety-critical systems, software is usually embedded in
some machine or hardware device \cite{Leveson95} that is sold as a product
\footnote{59 A.L.R.5th 461.}. When viewed from this standpoint, software is less
analogous to pure thoughts and expressions and may be considered a product for
products liability cases. Many forms of products liability exist, including
\textit{Contract}, \textit{Strict}, and \textit{Negligence}.

\textit{Contracts}, as in software warranties or End User License Agreements
(EULAs), are issued to assure customers that the products purchased will perform
as stated \cite{Armour93}. Contract law can be dismissed because, as described
in the next section, negligence liability applies regardless of what terms are
steted in any contract. Even if a contract disclaims risk, manufacturers are
still held accountable and cannot absolve themselves from liability from
defects \cite{Ryan03}.

\textit{Strict Liability} applies to any product that is defective, regardless
of the amount of care used in the process to manufacture it\footnote{63 Am. Jur.
2d Products Liability \S 90.}. While strict liability is interesting
\cite{Turner00}, this research is concerned with the \textit{processes} and
\textit{tradeoff} analysis involved with developing and testing software. These
aspects of software engineering fall under the jurisdiction of negligence law.

\subsection{Negligence}\label{SS:Negligence}
We apply negligence law to our research\footnote{Negligence is 
concerned with process, not with product. The question is not whether software 
development can be applied to negligence law, but if negligence law can apply to
software development.}.

The legal term negligence refers to, in general, careless conduct. Scholars
describe negligence more specifically as:

\singlespace
\begin{itemize}
 \item the existence and violation of a legal duty to use care, proximately 
 causing injury to another.
 \item the failure to exercise the degree of care demanded by the circumstances.
 \item the breach of a duty to another to protect him or her from the particular
 harm that ensued.
 \item the want of that care the law prescribes under the particular
 circumstances existing at the time of the act or omission which is involved.
\end{itemize}
\doublespace

Negligence can be applied to many different scenarios beyond products
liability. An intoxicated driver who disobeys traffic laws is negligent towards
other citizens of the road. A teacher who fails to demonstrate safety
precautions to his students in wood shop may be liable for negligence. An
engineer who does not adequately inspect his high-integrity product can be
negligent to his clients. This research focuses on the negligence constrains as
they apply to products liability.

According to the Learned Hand test\footnote{\textit{United States v. Carroll
Towing Co.}, 159 F.2d 169.\\ Judge Learned Hand created this guideline to
determine the amount of duty owed in a negligence dispute. In the case, the
United States sought compensation for flour that was lost when a barge carrying
the cargo sunk. The barge company was partly responsible because no workers were
present on the barge when it sank, which may have prevented the barge from
sinking. Qualitatively, the amount it would have cost to keep a worker on the
barge would have been less than the product of the probability that the barge
sank and the amount of damages incurred from it sinking.}, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:handtest}, an organization that develops safety-critical software has a
duty to spend at least the amount of time and resources equivalent to the
product of the severity of harm and the likelihood that it will happen. If they
do not, then their actions are negligent.

\subsubsection{Elements of Negligence}\label{SS:Elements}
The applicability of negligence may be ambiguous and the laws of negligence can
only be invoked in certain situations. The prerequisites, or prima facie
elements, of a negligence case are \cite{Dobbs01}:

\singlespace
\begin{enumerate}
 \item there exists a duty of care (or duty to protect)
 \item the defendant breaches this duty with unreasonably risky conduct
 \item the defendant's conduct resulted in harm to the plaintiff
 \item the negligent conduct was a proximate cause of harm
 \item legally recognized damages or injury exist
\end{enumerate}
\doublespace

First, a negligence case calls for an actual duty of care owed to a plaintiff.
There may be a question about how much care is owed in a given situation, but
there are circumstances in which there is no duty owed that bears on the harm a
plaintiff suffers. Judges decide whether or not this duty exists \cite{Dobbs01}.

Also, there must be a breach of this duty of care owed. A defendant who behaves
reasonably and exercises the necessary care required by law will not be
negligent even if the plaintiff is harmed \cite{Dobbs01}.

The defendant's negligence must be the cause of the harm suffered by the
plaintiff. An careless engineer who does not test his product is not negligent
to the user who is injured by tripping over the machine. In addition, the cause
must not only be cause in fact, but a proximate, or primary, cause of the harm
suffered \cite{Dobbs01}.

Finally, actual damages or injuries must be suffered for a negligence case to
follow suit. This can include personal injury or damages to property
\cite{Dobbs01}.

\subsubsection{Software Fulfills the Prima Facie}

It is not a stretch to conclude that defective software in a safety-critical
situation will be subject to negligence allegations. The developing
organization clearly owes a duty of care to its customers. Since the software
will be used to perform tasks that can potentially cause harm, its users expect
a reasonably prudent amount of care from its developers.

The remaining elements are assumptions that this research seeks to evaluate.
Performing tests is a large part of quality assurance for software and doing it
correctly can mitigate the risk of unreasonably breaching a duty of care.
