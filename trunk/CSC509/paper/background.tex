\chapter{Background}
The analysis of the legality of testing processes for software demands a
discussion of the constraints laid out by the law. Topics comprised in products
liability and negligence applicably lays out the obligations of software
engineers in the safety-critical realm.

The term \textit{products liability} broadly applies to the liability of a
manufacturer or seller (defendant) for injury to a buyer (plaintiff) caused by
a product that has been sold. While many forms of products liability
exist\footnote{\textit{Strict Liability} applies to any product that is
defective, regardless of the amount of care used in the process to manufacture
it. \textit{Contract} law applies when a manufacturer's product fails to match
the promises made in some written contract.}, we apply negligence law to our
research\footnote{Negligence is concerned with process, not with product. The
question is not whether software development can be applied to negligence law,
but if negligence law can apply to software development.}.

\section{Current Practices in Software Safety}
Despite the evidence of ineffective safety assurance \cite{Leveson93,Maisel05},
current trends in the software industry illustrate that efforts are being made
to ensure the safety of mission critical software applications.

\section{Negligence}
The legal term negligence refers to, in general, careless conduct. Scholars
describe negligence more specifically as:

\singlespace
\begin{itemize}
 \item the existence and violation of a legal duty to use care, proximately 
 causing injury to another.
 \item the failure to exercise the degree of care demanded by the circumstances.
 \item the breach of a duty to another to protect him or her from the particular
 harm that ensued.
 \item the want of that care the law prescribes under the particular
 circumstances existing at the time of the act or omission which is involved.
\end{itemize}

Negligence can be applied to many different scenarios beyond products
liability. An intoxicated driver who disobeys traffic laws is negligent towards
other citizens of the road. A teacher who fails to demonstrate safety
precautions to his students in wood shop may be liable for negligence. An
engineer who does not adequately inspect his high-integrity product can be
negligent to his clients. This research focuses on the negligence constrains as
they apply to products liability.

According to the Learned Hand test, an organization that develops 
safety-critical software has a duty to spend the amount of time and resources
equivalent to the product of the severity of harm and the likelihood that it
will happen. If they do not, then their actions are negligent.

\subsection{Elements of Negligence}
The applicability of negligence may be ambiguous and the laws of negligence can
only be invoked in certain situations. The prerequisites, or prima facie
elements, of a negligence case are \cite{Dobbs01}:

\singlespace
\begin{enumerate}
 \item there exists a duty of care (or duty to protect)
 \item the defendant breaches this duty with unreasonably risky conduct
 \item the defendant's conduct resulted in harm to the plaintiff
 \item the negligent conduct was a proximate cause of harm
 \item legally recognized damages or injury exist
\end{enumerate}
\doublespace

First, a negligence case calls for an actual duty of care owed to a plaintiff.
There may be a question about how much care is owed in a given situation, but
there are circumstances in which there is no duty owed that bears on the harm a
plaintiff suffers.

Also, there must be a breach of this duty of care owed. A defendant who behaves
reasonably and exercises the necessary care required by law will not be
negligent even if the plaintiff is harmed.

The defendant's negligence must be the cause of the harm suffered by the
plaintiff. An careless engineer who does not test his product is not negligent
to the user who is injured by tripping over the machine. In addition, the cause
must not only be cause in fact, but a proximate, or primary, cause of the harm
suffered.

Finally, actual damages or injuries must be suffered for a negligence case to
follow suit. This can include personal injury or damages to property.

\subsection{Software Fulfills the Prima Facie}

It is not a stretch to conclude that defective software in a safety-critical
situation will be subject to negligence allegations. The developing
organization clearly owes a duty of care to its customers. Since the software
will be used to perform tasks that can potentially cause harm, its users expect
a reasonably prudent amount of care from its developers.

The remaining elements are assumptions that this research seeks to evaluate.
Performing tests is a large part of quality assurance for software and doing it
correctly can mitigate the risk of unreasonably breaching a duty of care.
