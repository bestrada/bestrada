\chapter{Conclusions}

The work produced in this research is by no means sufficient for prudent testing
processes. Meeting sufficient conditions would guarantee a necessary condition.
Enumerating all of the measures to take to guarantee a software engineer's duty
of care is fulfilled would be an impossible task. This research establishes a
minimum criteria for software testing in relation to the social constraints
imposed by the law. Compliance with these measures will not absolve any party
from their legal obligations.

We argue, however, that in safety critical software systems the measures laid
out in our research are absolutely necessary, though not sufficient, for
software testing. Logical equivalence designates that not taking these
measures implies negligence and prudence implies taking these measures.
