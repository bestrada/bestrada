\section{Intended Audience}

This paper is not written specifically for technical audiences. As will be
discussed in later chapters, the goal of this research is to assist those who
wish to evaluate the amount of care that is put in to developing a software
product by the organization that developed it.

Judges, attorneys, and juries will find this work useful. Since software is a 
complex concept to grasp, this work will help non-experts understand the 
processes involved in creating such an intangible artifact.

Software engineers, particularly those involved in developing software products
that may be harmful to their users, may also be able to use this work over the
course of development to guide their processes.
