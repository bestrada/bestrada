\chapter{The Case of the Killer Robot}\label{A:Killer}

The Case of the Killer Robot consists of seven newspaper articles, one journal
article and one magazine interview. This scenario is intended to raise issues
of computer ethics and software engineering.

The people and institutions involved in this scenario are entirely fictitious
(except for references to Carnegie Mellon and Purdue universities and to the
venerable computer scientists Ben Shneiderman and Jim Foley). Silicon Valley
was chosen as the location for the accident because it is an icon of high
technology. All of the persons and institutions named in Silicon Valley are
purely fictitious.
