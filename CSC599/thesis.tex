I would like to express the utmost gratitude to Professor Clark Turner. His
enthusiasm has been inspiring and his insights invaluable. I owe much of my
success, both academic and professional, to his genuine encouragement and
positive influence.

I also would like to acknowledge the support and encouragement of my friends
during times of distress and decision-making. Danielle, Liz, Jonathan, Chris,
and Christina--each of whom has provided counsel in more ways than one.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents, Jim and Lourdes. Without their
support and direction I would not be the person I have become. I hope you are
proud.
