\chapter{Terminology}
This research, while intended for a wider audience, uses software-specific
terms. For clarity's sake, we define them here.

\begin{description}

\item[Testing:] the process used to verify or validate a system or its 
components \cite{Storey95}.

\item[Validation:] the process of confirming that the specification of a phase,
or the complete system, is appropriate and is consistent with the customer
requirements \cite{Storey95}. \textit{Are we building the right product?}

\item[Verification:] the process of determining whether the output of a
lifecycle phase fulfils the requirements specified by the previous phase
\cite{Storey95}. \textit{Are we building the product right?}
