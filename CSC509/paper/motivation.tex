\chapter{Motivation}

Although software does offer the benefits of added flexibility, increased
functionality, and reduced costs, it provides unprecedented possibilities for
errors. Safety-critical systems have been on the bandwagon of using software in
their implementations for some time, and disputes have since then occurred
regarding their stability. The advent of such systems juxtaposed with the
complexities of software breeds a new set of concerns that do not easily map to
traditional engineering standards.

Because of its unique nature, defects in software are inevitable and typically
more difficult to locate and handle than the physical flaws found in mechanical
components. Defects in software used in safety-critical situations can be
especially dangerous. The increasing use of software in machines and the demand
for more product functions adds complexity and more room for error. Models to
test, detect, and correct these errors exist and are continually improving.

Since testing is a key phase for software quality assurance, it is a clear
target for scrutiny under a legal dispute.

\section{General Problem Statement}
Are the current standards of procedure for software testing processes legally
sufficient ``reasonable'' quality control practices for detecting and correcting
harmful defects in safety-critical software and mitigating liability exposure?
