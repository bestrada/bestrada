\section{Legal Requirements for Testing Software}

It has been established that software developers in the safety-critical realm
owe a duty of care to the intended users of their software. Part of this duty
of care is the manufacturer's duty to test its products. Applicable law states
that:

\begin{quote}
``\textit{a manufacturer has a duty to test and inspect its products, at least
where the nature of the product is such that an injury from its use is 
foreseeable if the product is defective, and where tests or inspections are 
practicable and would be effective.}'' \cite{Testing2005}
\end{quote}

Since safety-critical software can cause injury, it is subject to this
stipulation. But as previously mentioned, the unique characteristics of
software offer new problems in testing that make it difficult to create a
mapping with traditional methods of engineering and the legal requirements for
testing. These legal requirements include ensuring the product is operable for
the purpose intended, securing the production of a finished and safe article,
using the most effective methods known and available, and testing and
inspecting during and after the course of manufacture.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Is the product reasonably fit for its intended purposes?
  \item Were the methods used conclusive and effective for demonstrating the
  products safety?
  \item Did the manufacturer exercise the most effective known or best available
  methods in their test strategy?
  \item Did the manufacturer perform tests even after the product was considered
  ``complete''?
\end{itemize}

\section{The Justice in Testing}


There are many aspects of testing software that satisfy these legal
requirements. When analyzing the legality of an organizations testing processes,
the following considerations should be made:

\begin{description}
\item[Verifiability] the software should be verified against its own 
requirements. The software's commodity considers if it is appropriate for it's
intended use. Did the tests match the severity of the product's expected
use? Verifiability measures how well the end software article complies with the
requirements set up before development.
\item[Completeness] the tests and inspections of the software should exhibit
complete coverage to the extent that is reasonably feasible. Completeness measures how thorough the tests were done for exhibiting product
safety.
\item[Credibility] the testing process used should be at least on par with what
is considered the state-of-the-art by other reasonably prudent software
engineers. Credibility refers to the conduct of
the testing manner customarily followed by others in the industry.
\item[Maintainability] software tests should not be a single stage of
development, but a pervasive process exercised throughout the product's
lifecycle. If defects were found after the fact, did they release
fixes? Maintainability measures how well the manufacturer preserves the quality
of their product throughout its life.
