\chapter{Introduction}

Historically, the product liability of software has not been an issue of
concern for three reasons. First, software was originally used only by experts
and corporations for limited and purposed uses beyond the reaches of end
users and the general public. Second, processor instruction sets were primitive
and software programs were very simple. Finally, the availability of attorneys
with applicable expertise to handle software cases has been rare. Today's
society no longer observes these limitations.

Organizations today are in the business of building better products faster,
cheaper, and more efficiently. As a result of society's demands, these
organizations find themselves increasingly relying on software for the benefits
of rapid deployment and efficiency over traditionally engineered physical
components. Over the years, software has almost become an ideal product.
Software can be created quickly and easily. There are little to no material
costs associated with producing software and there is no deterioration over
time. It can be replicated cheaply once written and, since the inception of the
Internet, it is more mutable (e.g. updateable) than ever. By now, computers
have progressed to the point where using software in solutions not only
possible, but more economically feasible than using solely hardware components \cite{Baase97}.
Software is oftentimes the only feasible alternative for solving certain
problems.

Complexity of software programs have also increased. Significant work in
programming only began in the 1950s, and mainstream software use didn't begin
until recently. But over time, knowledge of software has grown exponentially
and with developments like higher-level programming languages, object-oriented
design, and open source libraries, the complexity of software has equally
increased.

In addition, the number of qualified attorneys is growing. The American Bar
Association's computer law division has grown from 89 members in 1980 to over
1100 in 1993 \cite{Armour93}. Representation of computer science and other related
undergraduate majors in law schools is also growing.

Software devices continue to be used in risky situations. Microprocessors and
software are being used to control prosthetic limbs \cite{Graupe78}, to help
restore sight sight to the blind \cite{Fox95}, to automate the braking systems
in cars \cite{Hurtig94}, and even to treat cancer patients with radiation
\cite{Leveson93}. If the use of software continues to grow as it has been, then
disputes over its quality and the developers' liability will increasingly become
apparent in the legal world.
