Facebook is an online social network that allows people to connect with people 
and friends through schools, companies, regions and other groups. Coursebook is
a Facebook enabled website that provides general education course 
recommendations to its users. Coursebook utilizes a relational database of 
course offerings for California Polytechnic State University students to provide
this service. Coursebook is a multi-threaded, highly-concurrent web service 
built on the J2EE platform. By drawing from Facebook's user interests and 
profile information, Coursebook finds which general education classes would be
most appealing to each user. The main task of the system is to provide its users
with relevant general education courses based on their personal interests.

The intended domain is academic, targeting Cal Poly students seeking to enroll 
in general education courses. This gives students an alternative way of finding
general education courses that may interest them, rather than manually searching
through the long list of available classes in the Cal Poly course catalog. 
Coursebook also provides the option of manually entering interests through web
forms to find relevant courses, allowing more flexibility and functionality to
its users. Coursebook aims to provide a service that is:
